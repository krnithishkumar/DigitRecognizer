Then the model saved and downloaded. Deployment of the model is done in python Tkinter.
In python Tkinter application the canvas is created and used to paint on the mouse drag and
then it gets saved and resized for that model architecture. The predicted result is shown in 
the GUI Display.

Do Check out the source code and try it yourself with the different model architecture in the 
CNN Part and deploy the model with your own beautiful GUI.
